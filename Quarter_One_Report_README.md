# Product Sales Data Cleaning and Analysis

In this project, I performed data cleaning processes on product sales data to calculate the increase of product orders between the years 2022 and 2023. Here are the operations I conducted on the data:

- 🧹 **Check for Duplicate Data:**
  Identified and removed any duplicate entries from the dataset.

- 📝 **Standardize Product Category Names:**
  Ensured consistency in product category names by applying appropriate formulas.

- 📅 **Divide Order Date into Month and Year:**
  Utilized Excel functions such as `MONTH()` and `YEAR()` to split the order date into month and year components.

- 💰 **Calculate Total Before Tax:**
  Calculated the total before tax for each order by multiplying the retail price by the order quantity.

- 💳 **Calculate Order Total:**
  Determined the order total for each transaction by adding the total before tax to the tax due.

- 📊 **Calculate Q1 Total:**
  Used the `SUMIF` function to calculate the total sales for the first quarter (Q1) of a certain year.

- 📈 **Calculate Monthly Sales for 2022 and 2023:**
  Employed the `SUMIFS` function, which accepts multiple ranges criteria and multiple criteria, to calculate sales for the years 2022 and 2023 by month.

Stay tuned for more updates on the data analysis findings and insights!
